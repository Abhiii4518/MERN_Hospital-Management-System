# 🏥 Hospital Management System

## 📋 Project Overview

My **Hospital Management System** is a comprehensive software solution designed to manage various hospital operations efficiently. It includes modules for **patient registration**, **doctor appointments**, and **information management** for both patients and staff.

This application allows authorized personnel such as **administrators** or **receptionists** to log in using a secure **username and password**. Once authenticated, they can add, update, and retrieve data quickly and securely through a user-friendly interface.

- 🔍 Search for doctor availability and patient details using ID
- 🔐 Secure login system with role-based access (Admin/Receptionist)
- 📄 Easy data retrieval with a clean and responsive UI
- 🔒 Protected data storage for personal use
- ⚙️ Fast and efficient data processing
- 💳 Online payment of doctor fees
- 📝 Patients can view appointments and prescriptions
- 📬 Complaint handling system for users

## 🧩 Modules
